# Binary Clock for Arduino 

I try to implement an simple binary clock for an arduino R2.
All necessary code goes in here and later all the sketch and fritzing files will follow.

Via the script all code files can packed inside a lib and linked against other stuff. 
**All code is very unstable and there is a big room for improvement so be aware that using it can/will result 
in werid behavior of your arduino!**
